Modularization splits your code into logical functions and modules. This allows
you to reuse parts of your code

A few guidelines for Modularization:
1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!) - Generalize and consolidate repeated code in
loops or functions
2. Abstract out logic to improve readability - Abstracting out code into a
function not only makes it less repetitive but also improves the readability
with descriptive function names. Although your code can become more readable 
when you abstract out logic into functions, it is possible to over-engineer this
and have way too many modules, so use your judgement.
