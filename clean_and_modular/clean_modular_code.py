When using s/w products like Google, Amazon, Udacity e.t.c, the code that is
running the servers you are using is production code.

Ideally, code that is being used in production should meet a number of criteria
to ensure reliability and efficiency before it becomes public:

1. Code needs to be clean - code is clean when it is READABLE, SIMPLE AND CONCISE
(brief, yet including all important information). This is a characteristic of
production quality code which is crucial for collaboration an maintainability in
s/w development
clean code makes it easier for others and yourself to understand and reuse code

2. Code should be modular - This means your code is logically broken down into
functions and modules which makes your code more organized, efficient and reusable
You can encapsulate code in a function and reuse it by calling the function in
different places in your code

module - In programming, a module is a file. Modules allow code to be reused by
encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files

Splitting your code into logical functions and modules allow you to quickly find
relevant pieces of code
You can often generalize these pieces of code to be reused in different places
to prevent yourself from writing unnecessary lines of code

Abstracting out details into functions and modules can really help in improving
the readability of your code.
